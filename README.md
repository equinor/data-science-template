[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/mhew/data-science-template/_apis/build/status/data-science-template?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/mhew/data-science-template/_build/latest?definitionId=15&branchName=master)

# Data Science Template
This is a starter template for data science projects in Equinor, although it may also be useful for others. It contains many of the essential artifacts that you will need and presents a number of best practices including code setup, samples, MLOps using Azure, a standard document to guide and gather information relating to the data science process and more. 

As it is impossible to create a single template that will meet every projects needs, this example should be considered
a starting point and changed based upon the working and evolution of your project.

Before working with the contents of this template or Data Science projects in general it is recommended to familiarise yourself with the Equinor [Data Science Technical Standards](https://wiki.statoil.no/wiki/index.php/Statoil_Data_Science_Technical_Standards) (Currently Equinor internal only)

## Getting Started With This Template
This template is provided as a [Cookiecutter template](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) so you
can quickly create an instance customised for your project. An assumption is that you have a working python installation.

To get running, first install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher):

    pip install -U cookiecutter

### Create project
Then generate a new project for your own use based upon the template, answering the questions to customise the generated 
project:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/equinor/data-science-template.git
    
The values you are prompted for are:

| Value                   | Description |
| :---                    | --- |
| project_name            | A name for your project. Used mostly within documentation | 
| project_description     | A description to include in the README.md | 
| repo_name               | The name of the github repository where the project will be held |
| conda_name              | The name of the conda environment to use |
| package_name            | A name for the generated python package. | 
| mlops_name              | Default name for Azure ML. | 
| mlops_compute_name      | Default Azure ML compute cluster name to use. | 
| author                  | The main author of the solution. Included in the setup.py file | 
| open_source_license     | What type of open source license the project will be released under | 
| devops_organisation     | An Azure DevOps organisation. Leave blank if you aren't using Azure DevOps | 

If you are uncertain about what to enter for any value then just accept the defaults. You can always change the generated project later.

*Getting problems? You can always download this repository using the download button above and reference the local copy e.g. cookiecutter c:\Downloads\data-science-template, however ideally fix any git proxy or other issues that are causing problems.*

You are now ready to get started, however you should first create a new github repository for your new project and add your 
project using the following commands (substitute myproject with the name of your project and REMOTE-REPOSITORY-URL 
with the remote repository url).

    cd myproject
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin REMOTE-REPOSITORY-URL
    git remote -v
    git push origin master

### Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) increase quality by building, running tests and performing other validation whenever 
code is committed. The template contains a build pipeline for Azure DevOps, however requires a couple of manual
steps to setup:

* Log in to http://dev.azure.com and browse to, or create an organisation & project. The project name should be the same as your github repository name.
* Under *Pipelines -> Builds select* *New Pipeline*
* Select github and then your repository. Login / grant any permissions as prompted
* In the review pane click *run*

You are now setup for CI and automated test / building. You should verify the badge link in this README corresponds 
with your DevOps project, and as a further step might setup any release pipelines for automated deployment.

At this stage the build pipeline doesn't include MLOps steps, although these can be added based uon your needs.

### Finally

* Update the project readme file with additional project specific details including setup, configuration and usage. 
* The docs\process_documentation.md file should be completed phase by phase, and each phase result shall be submitted for review and approval before the project moves on to the next phase. This is to assist with the gathering of essential information required to deliver a correct and robust solution. The git respoitory shall be added to the script that populates the [knowledge repository](https://git.statoil.no/DataScience/projects) to ease future knowledge sharing.
